# A tale of two storms: effects of sea level rise and pre-existing conditions on biogeochemical response to tropical storms.  

**Running Title:** Hurricane influence on landscape biogeochemistry 

## Abstract

Hurricanes and tropical storms are high-energy episodic disturbances that have the potential to influence aquatic biogeochemical cycling in coastal environments on a landscape scale. This disturbance effect is typically two-fold where driving winds and significant wave energy causes a storm surge of marine water into freshwater ecosystems and intense rainfall enhances freshwater runoff and coastward transport of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) to downstream coastal systems. The magnitude of impact by storm surges and downstream transport modulated by upstream water levels may be influenced by increases in sea-level and changes in climate influencing how discrete storm events differentially alter coastal biogeochemistry. Therefore, our ability to predict impacts and manage ecosystem resilience to storms depends on understanding this interaction. In this study, we evaluate the changes in surface water total and inorganic C, total N and total P concentrations and fluxes before and after two major hurricanes tropical storms of similar trajectory and magnitude within the Florida Coastal Everglades. Hurricanes Wilma in late 2005 and Irma in 2017 made land-fall as a category 3 hurricane along the southwest Florida coast with different antecedent hydrologic conditions driven by different preceding weather patterns, water management and a significant decadal uptick in sea level. In this study, we evaluated three inter-related hypotheses about the impact of these two storms on aquatic biogeochemical dynamics. First, we anticipated that the higher water conditions existing after Irma increased the extent of the storm surge and therefore mobilized more C into the estuary and out of the ecosystem. Second, we expect that higher sea level allowed for Irma to deposit minerals and nutrients further into the interior of the ecosystem than observed Wilma when sea levels were relatively lower.  Finally, major storms have the potential to shift water column C to P stoichiometry due to increased mobilization of C and P across the landscape. Long term studies allowed us to uniquely evaluate the interaction between a long-term climate press and multiple disturbances, with climate drivers operating at different temporal scales that can synergistically interact to increase the pace of ecosystem change.
